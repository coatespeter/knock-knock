![image showing the responsiveness of the homepage](https://i.ibb.co/JkbW9PC/Screenshot-2023-10-02-at-10-17-26.png)

Welcome to Knock Knock, an interactive game of chance where you'll face off against the computer in a multi-choice game of luck. The goal? Get lucky three times in a row to emerge victorious!

It is designed to be very simple and nostalgic for players who were fans of th TV show "Takeshi's Castle".

## UX & DESIGN

Given that this website is designed as a single-serving platform, it comprises only one page. The chosen design approach prioritizes simplicity and cleanliness to ensure that it complements, rather than competes with, the central game section of the page.

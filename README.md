![image showing the responsiveness of the homepage](https://i.ibb.co/JkbW9PC/Screenshot-2023-10-02-at-10-17-26.png)

Welcome to Knock Knock, an interactive game of chance where you'll face off against the computer in a multi-choice game of luck. The goal? Get lucky three times in a row to emerge victorious!

It is designed to be very simple and nostalgic for players who were fans of th TV show "Takeshi's Castle".

## UX & DESIGN

Given that this website is designed as a single-serving platform, it comprises only one page. The chosen design approach prioritizes simplicity and cleanliness to ensure that it complements, rather than competes with, the central game section of the page.

## USER STORIES

- As a player, I want to be able to hear the theme song by clicking the    "Play Music" button, so that I can have an immersive experience.
  
- As a player, I want to read the game instructions by clicking the "Instructions" button, so that I can understand how to play the    game.
  
- As a player, I want to see the game image and directional buttons on the page, so that I can make choices in the game.
  
- As a player, I want to be able to choose a direction (left, middle, or right) by clicking the corresponding button, so that I can    progress in the game.
  
- As a player, I want the game to indicate if I've successfully ripped through a door or if I've banged into a wall, so that I can       track my progress.
  
- As a player, I want my score to reset to 0 if I bang into a wall, so that I can have a fresh start.
  
- As a player, I want the game to display a winning image and a "Play Again" button if I successfully rip through three doors in a       row, so that I know I've won.
  
- As a player, I want to be able to click the "Play Again" button to reset the game after winning, so that I can play again.
  
- As a player, I want to be able to click the "Reset" button at any time to restart the game, so that I can start over if I choose to.
  
- As a player, I want to know that winning is based on luck and there are no specific strategies, so that I can approach the game with a fair chance.

## WIREFRAMES

![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/7Cn3nSM/initial-wireframe.png)

This was the initial wireframe for the project. The final design is very similar to this, with the exception of the "Play Again" button, which was added to the final design. I also decided to remove the vs computer button as it was not necessary for the game.

## COLOUR SCHEME

## TYPOGRAPHY

I used Google Fonts to choose the typography for this project.

## FEATURES

Favicon
![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/0Bx3V2Z/Screenshot-2023-10-03-at-09-23-39.png)

The favicon was created using [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/). I drew an image of General Lee from the TV show Takeshi's Castle and uploaded it to the site. The site then generated a favicon.ico file which I downloaded and added to the project.
